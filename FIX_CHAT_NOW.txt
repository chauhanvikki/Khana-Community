🔧 CHAT FIX - DO THIS NOW
==========================

✅ ALL CODE CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE!

Now you just need to:

1. RESTART YOUR BACKEND SERVER
   ---------------------------
   Stop the backend (Ctrl+C)
   Then start it again:
   
   npm run dev
   (or: node backend/index.js)

2. REFRESH YOUR BROWSER
   --------------------
   Press F5 or Ctrl+R to reload the page

3. TEST THE CHAT
   -------------
   a) Login as DONOR → Create donation
   b) Login as VOLUNTEER (different browser) → Accept donation
   c) As VOLUNTEER: Click "Chat with Donor" button
   d) Type message and click Send
   e) Switch to DONOR: Click "Chat with [Volunteer Name]"
   f) See the message and reply!

🐛 IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK:
---------------------------

Open browser console (F12) and check:
1. What do you see when clicking chat button?
2. What error shows when sending message?
3. What's in the Network tab?

Then check CHAT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md for solutions!
