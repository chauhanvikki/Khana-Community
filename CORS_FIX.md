# CORS Error Fix

## âœ… Issue Fixed: CORS Policy Blocking Requests

**Problem**: 
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://khana-community.onrender.com/api/auth/signup' 
from origin 'https://khana-community.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Root Cause**: Backend CORS configuration didn't include the correct frontend URL.

## ðŸ”§ Solutions Applied:

### 1. **Fixed Frontend URL**
- **Before**: `https://khana-community-kfoc.vercel.app`
- **After**: `https://khana-community.vercel.app`

### 2. **Enhanced CORS Configuration**
- Added wildcard support for Vercel deployments
- Included proper HTTP methods and headers
- Added fallback for mobile apps (no origin)

### 3. **Updated Socket.io CORS**
- Applied same origin checking for WebSocket connections
- Ensured real-time chat works across domains

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:

**Restart your backend server:**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**The CORS error should now be resolved!** âœ…

Your frontend at `https://khana-community.vercel.app` can now successfully communicate with your backend at `https://khana-community.onrender.com`. ðŸŽ‰
