# Testing Guide - Verify All Fixes

## Quick Test Steps

### Test 1: User Data Isolation (Most Important!)

**Goal:** Verify that different users cannot see each other's data

**Steps:**
1. Create two donor accounts:
   - Donor A: `donor1@test.com` / `password123`
   - Donor B: `donor2@test.com` / `password123`

2. **Login as Donor A:**
   ```
   - Go to donor login page
   - Login with donor1@test.com
   - Create 2-3 donations with different food names
   - Note: Header should say "Welcome, Donor A" and "Role: donor"
   - Verify: You see ONLY your donations in the table
   - Click Logout
   ```

3. **Login as Donor B:**
   ```
   - Go to donor login page
   - Login with donor2@test.com
   - Note: Header should say "Welcome, Donor B" and "Role: donor"
   - Verify: Donations table is EMPTY (no donations from Donor A)
   - Create 1-2 donations with different food names
   - Verify: You see ONLY YOUR donations (not Donor A's)
   ```

4. **Login as Donor A again:**
   ```
   - Logout from Donor B
   - Login as Donor A again
   - Verify: You see ONLY Donor A's original donations
   - Verify: Donor B's donations are NOT visible
   ```

‚úÖ **Expected Result:** Each donor sees ONLY their own donations, never another donor's data

### Test 2: Volunteer Dashboard Role Display

**Goal:** Verify volunteer role shows as "Volunteer" (not "Donor")

**Steps:**
1. Create a volunteer account:
   - Go to volunteer signup
   - Email: `volunteer1@test.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Role: Volunteer

2. **Login as Volunteer:**
   ```
   - Go to volunteer login page
   - Login with volunteer1@test.com
   - Check the header
   ```

‚úÖ **Expected Result:**
- Header shows: "Welcome, [Volunteer Name] üëã"
- Below header shows: "Role: Volunteer" (NOT "Role: Donor")
- Logout button is visible

---

### Test 3: Donor Names in Volunteer Dashboard

**Goal:** Verify that volunteer can see donor names for each task

**Setup:**
1. Login as Donor A and create a donation
2. Login as Donor B and create a donation
3. Logout

**Test:**
1. Login as volunteer1@test.com
2. Look at the "Available Tasks" table

‚úÖ **Expected Result:**
- Each task row shows the donor's name in the "Donor" column
- Example: "John Doe" or "Jane Smith" (not "Unknown Donor")
- Phone numbers are visible

**Test Task Claiming:**
1. Click "Accept" on one of the tasks
2. Look at "Your Upcoming Tasks" table

‚úÖ **Expected Result:**
- Claimed task shows donor name
- Shows food name, quantity, pickup date
- Status shows "claimed"

---

### Test 4: Logout Functionality

**Goal:** Verify logout clears all data and requires re-login

**Steps:**

**For Donor:**
1. Login as any donor
2. Click the red "Logout" button in top-right
3. Try to navigate back to `/auth/welcome` (dashboard)

‚úÖ **Expected Result:**
- Redirected to login page
- Cannot access dashboard without logging in
- Browser's localStorage is empty (check DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage)

**For Volunteer:**
1. Login as volunteer
2. Click the "Logout" button
3. Try to navigate to `/volunteer/dashboard`

‚úÖ **Expected Result:**
- Redirected to volunteer login page
- Cannot access dashboard without logging in

---

### Test 5: JWT Token Expiration

**Goal:** Verify automatic logout on invalid/expired token

**Steps:**
1. Login as any user (donor or volunteer)
2. Open Browser DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage
3. Delete the "token" item OR modify it to random text
4. Try to create a donation or accept a task

‚úÖ **Expected Result:**
- Gets unauthorized error (401)
- Automatically logged out and redirected to login page
- localStorage is cleared

---

## Browser DevTools Checks

### Check localStorage (should be clean)

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí http://localhost:5173
3. After login, you should see:
   ```
   token: <JWT_TOKEN>
   donorId: <USER_ID>
   donorName: <USER_NAME>
   donorEmail: <USER_EMAIL>
   userRole: donor (or volunteer)
   ```
4. After logout, localStorage should be COMPLETELY EMPTY

### Check Network Requests

**For Donor Dashboard:**
1. Login as donor
2. Go to Network tab in DevTools
3. Look for requests to:
   - `GET /api/auth/me` - Should return user profile
   - `GET /api/donations/my-donations` - Should return only user's donations
4. Check the Authorization header: Should have `Bearer <token>`

**For Volunteer Dashboard:**
1. Login as volunteer
2. Check requests to:
   - `GET /api/auth/me` - Should return volunteer profile with role: "volunteer"
   - `GET /api/donations/available` - Available tasks with donor names
   - `GET /api/donations/volunteer` - Claimed tasks with donor names

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot access dashboard"
**Solution:** Make sure both backend and frontend are running:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Issue: "Donations not showing"
**Cause:** Token might be expired or invalid
**Solution:** 
1. Logout completely
2. Clear browser cache and localStorage
3. Login again

### Issue: "Donor name shows as 'Unknown Donor'"
**Cause:** Donation was created before donor information was properly populated
**Solution:**
1. Create a NEW donation after logging in
2. The new donation should have donor name populated

### Issue: "Still seeing previous user's data"
**Cause:** Old code or cache
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Clear localStorage manually
3. Restart frontend development server

---

## Success Criteria

All tests pass if:

‚úÖ Each donor sees ONLY their own donations (complete isolation)
‚úÖ Volunteer dashboard shows "Role: Volunteer" 
‚úÖ All donor names are visible in volunteer's task lists
‚úÖ Logout completely clears localStorage and prevents access
‚úÖ No authentication errors in browser console
‚úÖ All API calls include proper Authorization headers

---

## Quick Debugging Commands

### Check if backend is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000
# Should return: "üç± Khana Community Backend Running"
```

### Check JWT token validity:
1. Copy token from localStorage
2. Go to https://jwt.io
3. Paste token in debugger
4. Verify it contains: `id`, `name`, `email`, `role`

### MongoDB Check (if using MongoDB Compass):
1. Connect to your MongoDB instance
2. Look at `users` collection - verify roles are set correctly
3. Look at `donations` collection - verify `donorId` is populated

## Expected Console Output (No Errors)

**Good Console (During Login):**
```
Logged in: {token: "...", role: "donor", ...}
```

**Good Console (Loading Dashboard):**
```
Available tasks response: [{...}, {...}]
Accepted tasks response: [{...}]
```

**Bad Console (Fix Required):**
```
‚ùå Error fetching donations: 401 Unauthorized
‚ùå Token decode error
‚ùå No token received
```
